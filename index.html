                <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
                    The bar chart below represents the market caps for the largest companies traded publicly in the S&P 
                    500. The list of companies is composed of the top 5 technology based companies and the top 5 non 
                    technology based companies. The <code>’ticker’</code> dropdown also includes the options 
                    <code>’Tech Industry’</code> and <code>’Other Industries’</code>.
                    These market caps are summed and divided by the number of companies (5) to show the mean market cap data.
                    <br><strong>The Other Industries 
                        are representing the top 5 non tech companies, not the entire space of non tech companies.
                    </strong> In other visualizations, tech industries only make up about 30% of the S&P 500 since 
                    there are many more non tech companies.
