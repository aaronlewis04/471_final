        <p>In today’s world, growing concern surrounds the widening gap between the ultra-wealthy and the general public.<sup><a href="references.html#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup> This wage divide is reshaping the fabric of modern American society, deepening economic and social divides.<sup><a href="references.html#fn2" id="ref2">[2]</a></sup> 
          As a group of computer science students, our attention was drawn to what many consider a modern-day Gold Rush and a creator of some of today's most well-known tycoons: the tech industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          We began by looking at the industry metrics and came discover that that there is a cause for calling the tech industry by that nickname. 
          The data hasn't lied: this industry and the giants within it have grown at a fast pace. Exceeding the growth of non-tech large corporations.

                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    The line graph below represents the market caps for the largest companies traded publicly in the S&P 
                    500. Our list of companies is composed of the top 5 technology based companies and the top 5 non 
                    technology based companies (ranked by market-cap size). The <code>'ticker'</code> dropdown also includes the options 
                    <code>'Tech Industry'</code> and <code>'Other Industries'</code>. </p>
                    <p>
                    These market caps are summed and divided by the number of companies (5) to show the mean market cap data.
                    <strong>The Other Industries segment
                         represents the top 5 non-tech companies, not the entire space of non-tech companies.
                    </strong> In other visualizations, tech industries only make up about 30% of the S&P 500 since 
                    there are many more non-tech companies.<sup><a href="references.html#fn3" id="ref3">[3]</a></sup>
                    The tech companies are Apple Inc (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN), NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), Alphabet Inc (GOOG), and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). The non-tech "other" companies are Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRK), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY), Visa Inc. (V), and Walmart Inc. (WMT).

        <p>The graphic builds upon the previous and allows users to examine the top 20 US based companies by market cap size and examine other metrics such as the earnings in 2024 and earnings-to-employee ratio in 2024. As one can observe, the technology companies tend to have the highest market caps (8 companies above 1 trillion), the highest earnings, and high earnings-to-employee ratios. NVIDIA has a staggering $2.3M earnings per employee since they have a relatively low amount of employees. This demonstrates the concentration of wealth that these tech companies can acquire.

        <p>
          This stacked area chart compares the monthly active users of sites by popular tech companies (i.e. Google, YouTube, and Facebook) to 
          comparable large internet sites that are not owned by major tech companies (i.e. Wikipedia and Yahoo).  
         The data shows that the monthly visitors of Google, YouTube, and Facebook have grown 
          drastically while the visitors to Yahoo and Wikipedia have declined or largely not kept up with these other sites.  
          This demonstrates a growing dependance on and usage of web applications owned by "big tech" companies, meaning their products become 
          indispensable for daily needs.We took inspiration from the stacked area chart in observable plot gallery: <a target="_blank" href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-stacked-area-chart">Link</a><sup><a href="references.html#fn7" id="ref7">[7]</a></sup>

          <p>When we considered the rising power of the tech industry and public interest in economic inequality, we noticed
            a recurring theme in conversations about the economy. Issues such as the division of wealth<sup><a href="references.html#fn8" id="ref8">[8]</a></sup>, current economic 
            policies (which we do not intend to critique)<sup><a href="references.html#fn9" id="ref9">[9]</a></sup>, and concerns over the influence of unelected wealthy individuals in 
            politics<sup><a href="references.html#fn10" id="ref10">[10]</a></sup> have drawn frequent comparisons to a historical period: the Gilded Age.<sup><a href="references.html#fn11" id="ref11">[11]</a></sup> In fact,
            the current president of the United States has openly stated that, “We were at our richest from 1870 to 1913," directly referencing the period.<sup><a href="references.html#fn12" id="ref12">[12]</a></sup>
            </p>
          <p>
            
            When we had these two seemingly unrelated concepts: the almost futuristic wealth from "high tech" and a period over a century ago, 
            we realized that there might be trends or similarites and decided to investigate further. We decided to first consider the period and its context 
            to get a deeper understanding of what we are comparing and contrasting with.
          </p>
        <br>
        <h2><b>Part 2: Comparison to Gilded Age</b></h2>
        <p>
          First of all, let's start by discussing what the Gilded Age actually <em>was.</em> Characterized by the 
          period between the post-Civil War era to the early twentieth century off of the heels of the industrial revolution, the name came from author Mark Twain.<sup><a href="references.html#fn13" id="ref13">[13]</a></sup> The reference
          is to the concept of "gilding," where thin gold leaf is applied to the outer edges of something to make it appear as if it were made of gold. 
          The idea was that the society of the era was gilded: the upper crust led golden lives but underneath it was wood that rotted with nobody knowing. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This lollipop graph shows how the economy was faring in the Gilded Age and compares it to the Contemporary Era. 
          The data was found in a 2007 paper by Hugh Rockoff on the “Great Fortunes Of The Gilded Age”.<sup><a href="references.html#fn14" id="ref14">[14]</a></sup> Due to this the Contemporary Era was 1990-2006 
          and is not reflective of our current economy. The Gilded Age was a time period of great economic success by every major metric. The cost of living was decreasing, 
          real GDP was increasing, and the stock market was booming. We took inspiration from the lollipop chart in observable plot gallery: <a target="_blank" href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-lollipop">Link</a>
        </p>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

        <p>
          But not everything was as great as it seemed. The government's oversight 
          of industry was characterized as "laissez-faire" (to use a French term that means "let them do [what they will]"), 
          meaning that the government was hands-off.<sup><a href="references.html#fn15" id="ref15">[15]</a></sup>
          Theories of "social Darwinism" pushed an aggresively competetive society, with little aid to those who struggled. It was a perfect
          foundation for a vast gap in wealth.<sup><a href="references.html#fn16" id="ref16">[16]</a></sup>

          These 2 stacked bar charts show the percentage of wealth that the bottom 80%, top 20-5%, top 5-1%, and top 1% had across different years. 
          The data for the Gilded age came from Rockoff's paper<sup><a href="references.html#fn17" id="ref17">[17]</a></sup> and the contemporary data came from the world inequality database.<sup><a href="references.html#fn18" id="ref18">[18]</a></sup>
          The data for both are very similar, but there are a couple of important differences between them which limit our ability to directly compare them. 
          The first distinction is that the data for the Gilded Age is limited only to Massachusetts, while our contemporary data covers the entire US. 
          The second is that our gilded age data takes place over a period of 90 years in 10 year increments while our contemporary data takes place over a period of 13 years in 1 year increments. 
          The data for the Gilded Age was incredibly limited and this was the best data we could find.
          In the Gilded Age we can see the portion of the richest grow and the bottom 80% lose more and more of their share of the wealth. 
          In the Contemporary Era we find that all four of the groups stay relatively static in their proportions of the wealth, and while the bottom 80% is doing significantly better than they were 
          in the Gilded Age, the top 1% are as rich now as they were at the height of the Gilded Age. We took inspiration from the histogram chart in observable plot gallery: <a target="_blank" href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-histogram">Link.</a>

        <p>
          When we compared it to today, we were releived to see that modern breakdowns are not nearly as terrible. And an economist we consulted agreed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I’d hesitate to attempt to draw parallels between living standards of today and living 
          standards for the average American in the [G]ilded [A]ge," Aidan Owens, UMD Class of 2025, 
          told us. In fact, he said that "Americans are without a doubt living in the most prosperous economy ever." He explained that
          "The idea goes that, while worker productivity has skyrocketed (which is true), real wages have remained stagnant 
          (also true). The main problem with this analysis is that employees actually make enough to 
          cover the difference, but it’s paid out in non-wage benefits (like way better healthcare and more vacation and sick leave)."<sup><a href="references.html#fn19" id="ref19">[19]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          We examined "real wages" (which is wages adjusted for inflation) and CPI (which is, as Owens 
          described, "the average cost of [a] “basket” throughout the years. The basket is just a 
          collection of goods consumers buy" and indicates costs of living)<sup><a href="references.html#fn20" id="ref20">[20]</a></sup>
          in the recent decades (from the 1970s until this decade) and noticed that it was true: median weekly 
          wages (in "real wages" and therefore actual spending power) has been relatively steady, even rising.
        </p>

          This is a simple progression of the CPI (steadily moving upward with inflation) and the median weekly wages (steady 
          with a slight increase) taken from US Bureau of Labor Statistics.<sup><a href="references.html#fn21" id="ref21">[21]</a></sup>

        We concluded that between the economist interview and division of wealth data that looking at lower upper class to lower class would be a bit too complicated, but concluded that many things in this arena are likely better. 
        Instead, this led us to other economic comparisons. 
        </p>
        <p>
        This led our focus to the wealthiest of the wealthy, a comparison that did seem worth pursuing, 
        especially when we have a profile to compare: billionaires.</p>
        
        <p>
        We have a slew of famous rich tycoons in the Gilded Age, colloquially known as "Robber Barons," 
        who sunk their fingers into politics and are remembered  for their unimaginable wealth in 
        comparison to the general public. And in that we found our similarity: 
        tech billionaires.<sup><a href="references.html#fn22" id="ref22">[22]</a></sup>

        <h2><b>Part 3: Tech Billionaires</b></h1>
            <p>
              Coming back into the modern day, we decided to look at the actual breakdowns: 
              how much of the riches of the wealthy belong to so-called "tech-billionaires"?

                <h4><b>Share of Billionaires Net Worth Over Time in the US</b></h4>
                <p>
                  This bar chart uses a Kaggle<sup><a href="references.html#fn23" id="ref23">[23]</a></sup> dataset that compiles historical Forbes billionaire data to demonstrate the growth in billionaire wealth in the US over time. 
                  The graph can be viewed in a nominal or normalized mode, chosen by a dropdown menu. 
                  Using the normalized view, we can see that the influence of tech billionaires has grown quickly over the past 20 years. 
                  They have grown from representing 10% of billionaire wealth to now over 30%. 
                  Under the nominal view, We can see that the general wealth of billionaires has exploded from under 1 trillion in 2006 to 5.5 trillion in 2024, significantly outpacing growth in other metrics such as minimum wage.

              While we understand that many of the upper echelons of society probably have multiple streams of income, 
              the section of the wealth coming from tech alone is surprising.

            <h4><b>Concentration of Billionaires in the US By County of Residence 2023</b></h4>

                This graphic uses data from Kaggle<sup><a href="references.html#fn24" id="ref24">[24]</a></sup> and groups
                            billionaires in the US in 2023 and the cities that they live in. 
                            We used length visual encoding in the form of a spike to show a clear indication to the reader which cities have the greatest number of billionaires. Major tech hubs such as New York City, NY and San Francisco, CA have a high concentration of billionaires. There also tend to be many counties where the wealthiest billionaire is from Technology in the San Francisco and Hawaii areas. Many of the tallest spikes have their wealthiest  billionaire be from technology such as New York City having Michael Bloomberg, San Francisco having Brian Chesky, and Seattle having Jeff Bezos. We took inspiration from the Spike Map chart in observable plot D3 gallery: <a target="_blank"  href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-spike">Link</a>.

                Billionaire's political influence have been on the rise in recent years. 
                The best way to showcase this is through showing Billionaire political donations over time.
                Ever since the Supreme Court overturned Citizen United, which limited political donations, in 2010, Billionaire political donations has experience exponential growth.
                Although not shown in this dataset, the most recent 2024 election has made headlines for eye dropping billionaire contributions as well.

            <h2>Part 4: Conclusions</h2>
           <p>
             When comparing the contemporary era to the Gilded Age, it's important to recognize that the
             average American today enjoys a significantly higher quality of life. This improvement isn't
             solely due to wages, but also to a range of non-wage benefits such as access to healthcare,
             retirement planning, and a broader array of services. Technological advancements have also
             played a crucial role, enabling greater focus on family life and contributing to higher levels
             of education for the average child. However, we can absolutely compare the growth of billionaires’
             wealth in the contemporary era compared to the gilded era. Based on our visualizations and data
             exploration above, we can see that tech billionaires have accumulated an extraordinary amount of
             wealth over the last decade and a half. But why should we care, and what does that mean for us?
             <br><br>
             One statement that can be agreed upon by many is that while money might not necessarily buy
             someone happiness, it can most certainly buy power. In today’s capitalist driven society, having
             an influential amount of purchasing power can change the lives of many Ameircans indirectly.
             Wealth allows these tech billionaires to shape public policy, influence elections, and steer the
             direction of industries through lobbying and campaign contributions. These created policies are
             <strong>not</strong> always aligned with the concerns of the average American, rather they are
             aligned with companies run by the tech billionaires to help both entities make more profit, often
             with relaxed regulations and tax cuts.<br><br>
             We can see some modern examples of these tech billionaires and their companies influencing aspects
             of our lives that we interact with on the daily. Below are some interesting sources where you can
             see these effects taking place:<br>

               <p>
                 Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of The Washington Post, has significantly reshaped the
                 newspaper's editorial direction. In early 2025, Bezos oversaw a revamp of the opinion section
                 to emphasize themes aligned with “personal liberties and free markets,” leading to the
                 dismissal of columnists who challenged those perspectives. This shift highlights how immense
                 personal wealth can steer public discourse and frame narratives for millions of readers,
                 reinforcing the idea that money doesn’t just buy influence—it shapes the lens through which
                 society interprets reality.

               <p>
                 Elon Musk’s influence on American policy has grown increasingly visible, particularly in
                 conversations surrounding EV subsidies, infrastructure, and space exploration. Musk's direct
                 communication with the White House and policymakers has helped shape legislation that supports
                 the growth of his companies, like tax credits for electric vehicles and expanded government
                 contracts for SpaceX. While these policies aim to push innovation, they also reflect how the
                 priorities of a single wealthy individual can cascade into nationwide effects—impacting how
                 everyday Americans travel, work, and access technology.

               <p>
                 Microsoft’s substantial investment in OpenAI has extended beyond funding into strategic
                 control. With a major stake in the company, Microsoft played a key role in influencing board
                 decisions, including the controversial removal and reinstatement of CEO Sam Altman. These
                 moves reflect how corporate power can dictate the direction of cutting-edge technology
                 development. As AI becomes increasingly embedded in everyday tools—from search engines to
                 workplace software—Microsoft’s influence over OpenAI showcases how economic power can shape
                 technological futures for billions, often without broad public accountability.
