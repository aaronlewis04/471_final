        <br>
        <p>In today’s world, growing concern surrounds the widening gap between the ultra-wealthy and the general public.<sup><a href="references.html#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup> This wage divide is reshaping the fabric of modern American society, deepening economic and social divides.<sup><a href="references.html#fn2" id="ref2">[2]</a></sup> 
          As a group of computer science students, our attention was drawn to what many consider a modern-day Gold Rush and a creator of some of today's most well-known tycoons: the tech industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          We began by looking at the industry metrics and came discover that that there is a cause for calling the tech industry by that nickname. 
          The data hasn't lied: this industry and the giants within it have grown at a fast pace. Exceeding the growth of non-tech large corporations.

                <h4><b>Visualizing and Comparing Market Caps of Major, Publicly Traded Tech vs Non -Tech US-Based Companies (src: Yahoo Finance)</b></h4>
                <!-- Introductory description and layout -->
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    The line graph below represents the market caps for the largest companies traded publicly in the S&P 
                    500. Our list of companies is composed of the top 5 technology based companies and the top 5 non 
                    technology based companies (ranked by market-cap size). The <code>'ticker'</code> dropdown also includes the options 
                    <code>'Tech Industry'</code> and <code>'Other Industries'</code>. </p>
                    <p>
                    These market caps are summed and divided by the number of companies (5) to show the mean market cap data.
                    <strong>The Other Industries segment
                         represents the top 5 non-tech companies, not the entire space of non-tech companies.
                    </strong> In other visualizations, tech industries only make up about 30% of the S&P 500 since 
                    there are many more non-tech companies.<sup><a href="references.html#fn3" id="ref3">[3]</a></sup>
                    The tech companies are Apple Inc (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN), NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), Alphabet Inc (GOOG), and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). The non-tech "other" companies are Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRK), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY), Visa Inc. (V), and Walmart Inc. (WMT).

        <h4><b>Top 20 Largest Market-Cap Companies in US Ranked by Chosen Metric</b></h4>
        <p>The graphic builds upon the previous and allows users to examine the top 20 US based companies by market cap size and examine other metrics such as the earnings in 2024 and earnings-to-employee ratio in 2024. As one can observe, the technology companies tend to have the highest market caps (8 companies above 1 trillion), the highest earnings, and high earnings-to-employee ratios. NVIDIA has a staggering $2.3M earnings per employee since they have a relatively low amount of employees. This demonstrates the concentration of wealth that these tech companies can acquire. <sup><a href="references.html#fn6" id="ref6">[6]</a></sup></p>

      <h4><b>Monthly Visitors at Top 5 Consistently Popular Websites (2010 - 2024)</b></h4>
        <p>
          This stacked area chart compares the monthly active users of sites by popular tech companies (i.e. Google, YouTube, and Facebook) to 
          comparable large internet sites that are not owned by major tech companies (i.e. Wikipedia and Yahoo).  
         The data shows that the monthly visitors of Google, YouTube, and Facebook have grown 
          drastically while the visitors to Yahoo and Wikipedia have declined or largely not kept up with these other sites.  
          This demonstrates a growing dependance on and usage of web applications owned by "big tech" companies, meaning their products become 
          indispensable for daily needs.<sup><a href="references.html#fn7" id="ref7">[7]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
        <iframe width="900" height="500" frameborder="0"

        </div>
          <p>When we considered the rising power of the tech industry and public interest in economic inequality, we noticed
            a recurring theme in conversations about the economy. Issues such as the division of wealth<sup><a href="references.html#fn8" id="ref8">[8]</a></sup>, current economic 
            policies (which we do not intend to critique)<sup><a href="references.html#fn9" id="ref9">[9]</a></sup>, and concerns over the influence of unelected wealthy individuals in 
            politics<sup><a href="references.html#fn10" id="ref10">[10]</a></sup> have drawn frequent comparisons to a historical period: the Gilded Age.<sup><a href="references.html#fn11" id="ref11">[11]</a></sup> In fact,
            the current president of the United States has openly stated that, “We were at our richest from 1870 to 1913," directly referencing the period.<sup><a href="references.html#fn12" id="ref12">[12]</a></sup>
            </p>
          <p>
            
            When we had these two seemingly unrelated concepts: the almost futuristic wealth from "high tech" and a period over a century ago, 
            we realized that there might be trends or similarites and decided to investigate further. We decided to first consider the period and its context 
            to get a deeper understanding of what we are comparing and contrasting with.
