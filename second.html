        <h1>Part 2: Comparison to Gilded Age</h1>
        <h6> Created by Justin Zhai, Ezra Cohen, Mia Cohen, Saurav Patel, Aaron Lewis </h6>
        <br>
        <p>
          First of all, let's start by discussing what the Gilded Age actually <em>was.</em> Characterized by the 
          period between the post-Civil War era to the early twentieth century, the name came from author Mark Twain.<sup><a href="references.html#fn10" id="ref10">[10]</a></sup> The reference
          is to the concept of "gilding," where thin gold leaf is applied to the outer edges of something to make it appear as if it were made of gold. 
          The idea was that the society of the era was gilded: the upper crust led golden lives but underneath it was wood that rotted with nobody knowing. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The government's oversight 
          of industry was characterized as "laissez-faire" (to use a French term that means "let them do [what they will]"), 
          meaning that the government was hands-off.<sup><a href="references.html#fn11" id="ref11">[11]</a></sup>
          Theories of "social Darwinism" pushed an aggresively competetive society, with little aid to those who struggled. It was a perfect
          foundation for a vast gap in wealth.<sup><a href="references.html#fn12" id="ref12">[12]</a></sup>

          These 2 stacked bar charts show the percentage of wealth that the bottom 80%, top 20-5%, top 5-1%, and top 1% had across different years. 
          The data for both are very similar, but there are a couple of important differences between them which limit our ability to directly compare them. 
          The first distinction is that the data for the Gilded Age is limited only to Massachusetts, while our contemporary data covers the entire US. 
          The second is that our gilded age data takes place over a period of 90 years in 10 year increments while our contemporary data takes place over a period of 13 years in 1 year increments. 
          The data for the Gilded Age was incredibly limited and this was the best data we could find.
          In the Gilded Age we can see the portion of the richest grow and the bottom 80% lose more and more of their share of the wealth. 
          In the Contemporary Era we find that all four of the groups stay relatively static in their proportions of the wealth, and while the bottom 80% is doing significantly better than they were 
          in the Gilded Age, the top 1% are as rich now as they were at the height of the Gilded Age.<sup><a href="references.html#fn13" id="ref13">[13]</a></sup> <sup><a href="references.html#fn14" id="ref14">[14]</a></sup>

        <p>
          When we compared it to today, we were releived to see that modern breakdowns are not nearly as terrible. And an economist we consulted agreed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I’d hesitate to attempt to draw parallels between living standards of today and living 
          standards for the average American in the [G]ilded [A]ge," Aidan Owens, UMD Class of 2025, 
          told us. In fact, he said that "Americans are without a doubt living in the most prosperous economy ever." He explained that
          "The idea goes that, while worker productivity has skyrocketed (which is true), real wages have remained stagnant 
          (also true). The main problem with this analysis is that employees actually make enough to 
          cover the difference, but it’s paid out in non-wage benefits (like way better healthcare and more vacation and sick leave)."<sup><a href="references.html#fn15" id="ref15">[15]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          We examined "real wages" (which is wages adjusted for inflation) and CPI (which is, as Owens 
          described, "the average cost of [a] “basket” throughout the years. The basket is just a 
          collection of goods consumers buy" and indicates costs of living)<sup><a href="references.html#fn16" id="ref16">[16]</a></sup>
          in the recent decades (from the 1970s until this decade) and noticed that it was true: median weekly 
          wages (in "real wages" and therefore actual spending power) has been relatively steady, even rising.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a simple progression of the CPI (steadily moving upward with inflation) and the median weekly wages (steady 
          with a slight increase) taken from US Bureau of Labor Statistics.<sup><a href="references.html#fn17" id="ref17">[17]</a></sup>
        </p><br>
        <p>
        We concluded that between the economist interview and division of wealth data that looking at lower upper class to lower class would be a bit too complicated, but concluded that many things in this arena are likely better. 
        Instead, this led us to other economic comparisons. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        This led our focus to the wealthiest of the wealthy, a comparison that did seem worth pursuing, 
        especially when we have a profile to compare: billionaires.
        <br> <br>
        We have a slew of famous rich tycoons in the Gilded Age, colloquially known as "Robber Barons," 
        who sunk their fingers into politics and are remembered  for their unimaginable wealth in 
        comparison to the general public. And in that we found our similarity: 
        tech billionaires.<sup><a href="references.html#fn18" id="ref18">[18]</a></sup>
