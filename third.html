        <h1>Tech Billionaires</h1>
        <h6> Created by Justin Zhai, Ezra Cohen, Mia Cohen, Saurav Patel, Aaron Lewis </h6>
        <br>
        <p>
          Coming back into the modern day, we decided to look at the actual breakdowns: 
          how much of the riches of the wealthy belong to so-called "tech-billionaires"?
        </p>

         <div id="JustinViz" >
            <h3>Share of Billionaires Net Worth Over Time in the US</h3>
            <p>
              This bar chart uses a Kaggle<sup><a href="references.html#fn23" id="ref23">[23]</a></sup> dataset that compiles historical Forbes billionaire data to demonstrate the growth in billionaire wealth in the US over time. 
              The graph can be viewed in a nominal or normalized mode, chosen by a dropdown menu. 
              Using the normalized view, we can see that the influence of tech billionaires has grown quickly over the past 20 years. 
              They have grown from representing 10% of billionaire wealth to now over 30%. 
              Under the nominal view, We can see that the general wealth of billionaires has exploded from under 1 trillion in 2006 to 5.5 trillion in 2024, significantly outpacing growth in other metrics such as minimum wage.

        <p>
          While we understand that many of the upper echelons of society probably have multiple streams of income, 
          the section of the wealth coming from tech alone is surprising. When we looked even furhter into the wealthy of today, we saw another tie to technology:

              This graphic uses data from Kaggle<sup><a href="references.html#fn24" id="ref24">[24]</a></sup> and groups
              billionaires in the US in 2023 and the cities that they live in. 
              We used length visual encoding in the form of a spike to show a clear indication to the reader which cities have the 
              greatest number of billionaires. Major tech hubs such as New York City, NY and San Francisco, CA have a high concentration 
              of billionaires  It is also very clear that there are very few 
              billionaires in certian regions such as the Midwest or South-western states. From this, we can see at the very least a corroloation between tech and the wealthy.

        <h6>Conclusions:</h6>
        <p>
          We have come to conclude the following aspects:

          While the average American can not and should not be compared to the average American in the Gilded Age, 
          we absolutely can see parallels in the ultra-wealthy. Among them, we can see that tech billionaires are this
          era's Rockefeller and Carnagie, amassing unbelivable sums of wealth and involving themselves in politics to a 
          newsworthy degree. Just as in the Gilded Era, we are coming into a time of rapid technological change, and it seems we have the 
          billionaires to match it.
