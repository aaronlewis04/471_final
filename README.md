## Inspiration
When all of us met, one thing we agreed on is the increasing awareness of the wealth divide continuing to grow in American society. With the recent pandemic in 2020, a range of interest rates since that period and the emerging growth and integration of AI in our lives today, we all decided to focus on how these factors impact the richest people in the world: Billionaires. The key observation that we found was that these billionaires actually benefitted from the factors influencing society today while the average american's wealth stayed the same or even decreased in terms of quality. How can that be when the US stock market rose about 14.25% year over year? It turns out that this is not the first time we have seen this type of trend with a country's economic growth and billionaire wealth accumulation-- we have seen it before in the gilded age. After doing some initial research, we found out that specifically tech billionaires (and billionaires that invested into the technology sector) have seen monumental returns on their investments making them incredibly wealthy. We decided to focus our study to see if we can find correlations between today's modern society vs. the gilded age seen about 1 and a half centuries ago.
